Usage
-----

var apiClient = new ApiClient("YourFirstGivingKey", "YourFirstGivingSecret", "https://api.firstgiving.com/"); // Use http://usapisandbox.fgdev.net/ for sandbox
var donation = new Donation(new Guid("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"), "donation description", 25.0M);
var paymentData = new CreditCardPaymentData("First", "Last", "1 Main St.", "Burlington", "01803", "US", new MailAddress("test@example.org"),
                "CardNumberHere", CreditCardKind.Visa, new DateTime(2012, 01, 01), "111");

var transactionID = apiClient.DonateByCreditCard(donation, paymentData, "127.0.0.1");


Documentation
-------------

Code should be fairly straight forward. Required fields are asked in constructors, optional are public properties. Restrictions (such as length and format) are available in the API information link up there.
